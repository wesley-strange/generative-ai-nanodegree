Trailing by as much as 18 late in the second quarter, the Mavericks shot 60.5% from the floor (23-for-38) after halftime, with Kyrie Irving scoring 13 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. Dončić's 13 assists primarily went to centers Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II, who combined for 30 points on 14-of-16 shooting. Following Dončić's go-ahead three with 3.0 seconds left, Naz Reid, who was previously 7-of-8 from deep, missed a potential buzzer-beating three for the Timberwolves. Gobert notched a double-double, while Mike Conley added 18 points, but the All-Star duo of Edwards and Towns continued to struggle, as they combined to shoot 9-for-33 (27%) from the field, with Towns benched during the fourth quarter.\",\n",
       " ' For the third consecutive game, Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving delivered in the clutch for the Mavericks, finishing with 33 points each and leading a decisive 14–3 run to conclude the game as Dallas took a commanding 3–0 series lead. Dončić and Irving outscored the Timberwolves in the fourth quarter 21–20, as the duo shot 8-of-10 from the field. Dončić also recorded five steals, while P. J. Washington contributed 16 points, eight rebounds, and a go-ahead three-pointer for the Mavericks, who shot 14-of-28 from beyond the arc and 55.9% from the field. Anthony Edwards finished with 26 points, nine boards, and nine assists on an improved 11-of-24 shooting for Minnesota, but took just three shot attempts in the final quarter. Mike Conley and Jaden McDaniels added 16 and 15 points, respectively, while Karl-Anthony Towns shot 0-of-8 from deep, lowering his series three-point shooting percentage to 13.6% (3-for-22).',\n",

Anthony Edwards had 29 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists, while Towns, previously shooting 28% from the field in the series, finished 9-of-13 from the floor and 4-of-5 from beyond the arc. Rudy Gobert recorded another double-double, and Mike Conley tallied 14 points and four steals for Minnesota, who shot 58% in the second half. Daniel Gafford had three blocks on 6-of-6 shooting for the Mavericks, who were without Dereck Lively II due to a head injury from the previous game. Luka Dončić logged 28 points, 15 boards, and 10 assists for his sixth triple-double this postseason, but he and Kyrie Irving shot an inefficient 13-of-39 (33%) from the field, with Irving losing his first closeout game after previously being 14–0.',\n",
